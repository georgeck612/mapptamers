The SELEX process

Our hypothesis is that aptamers whose genetic sequences are close together in terms of edit distance will have similar affinities towards the same target cell.

First, we decompose our dataset into a patchwork of overlapping "balls" of aptamers, where each ball contains a collection of aptamers no more than a fixed edit distance away from any other. Since the balls are overlapping, we can then construct a network by defining nodes as balls of aptamers, and edges between nodes exist if there is an aptamer in common to the balls represented by the nodes.

This construction, called a *ball mapper* graph in our terminology, allows us to obtain a visual "map" of the entire starting aptamer library. Here a larger node size corresponds to one of our patches containing more aptamers, and its brightness corresponds to the average shortest distance between any two aptamers in the patch, which is a measure of *eccentricity.*

Now we can investigate the SELEX process using the mapper graph. During SELEX, aptamers undergo rounds of positive and negative selection; during positive selection aptamers are allowed to bind to a desired target molecule; those which do not are removed from the pool. During negative selection, aptamers are allowed to bind to a *non*-target molecule; those that do are removed from the pool. At each round, measurements for each aptamer are taken in *reads per 10 million* (RP10M).

Superimposing this round data onto the mapper graph allows us to see the SELEX process play out in real time. Adjusting node size to correspond to some RP10M statistic of a group of aptamers lets us visually pick out which "families," if any, are being selected for or against across rounds.
